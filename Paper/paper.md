# Summary #
In the nardl package [@zaghdoudi], we apply the ordinary least squares method to estimate the cointegrating nonlinear ARDL (NARDL) 
model developed by [@shin2014modelling] in which short and long-run nonlinearities are introduced via positive and negative partial 
sum decompositions of the explanatory variables.Besides, we provide the CUSUM, CUSUMSQ model stability tests, model selection via aic, 
bic and rsqaured criteria and the dynamic multipliers plot.
